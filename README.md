brief proposal :]
My plan for my zoom idea is maybe use a zoom video in Adobe and i try to do a video for 1 minute .
then for the project i was thinking about doing some creativity like maybe talk about some ideas about a story im working ( i cant specific that much because its a surpise )
and maybe in my green screen i want to put some funny cute images that could make people interested on what im saying  so that way people wont be bored of me and also maybe put the backgroun like im in space or something because i like seeing image of te galaxy full of stars.lastly another idea i want to do for my project is that if my teacher wants me to talk about the books then i will try to talk about the sumamry fo the book more about the author and how the story is.
